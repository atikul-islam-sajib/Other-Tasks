## Overview

This project performs geospatial clustering on a dataset and visualizes the results. The clustering is based on sociodemographic and geospatial data to segment customers into distinct groups for targeted analysis.

## Results

The following figures show the clustering results on a map, with each cluster represented by a different color:

Additionally, a Scree Plot was generated to determine the number of clusters:
