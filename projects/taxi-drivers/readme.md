#### Overview:
This Python script implements a Q-learning algorithm to solve the Taxi environment from OpenAI Gym. It includes training and testing phases to evaluate the agent's performance.

#### Features:
- **Initialization and Validation**: Sets up the environment and validates its properties.
- **Simulation with a Random Agent**: Simulates the environment with a random agent, recording experiences.
- **Training the Agent**: Utilizes Q-learning to train the agent, visualizing convergence.
- **Testing the Policy**: Evaluates the trained policy's performance, calculating mean epochs and failed drop-offs.

#### Requirements:
- Python (version >= 3.6)
- OpenAI Gym
- Required Python packages: `cmake`, `scipy`, `pygame`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `random`, `time`, `gymnasium`

#### Usage:
1. Install the required packages.
2. Run the script.
3. View animations and console output to observe agent behavior.
