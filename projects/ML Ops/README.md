### What are the key principles of ml-ops?

    1. Iterative-Incremental Development
    2. Levels of Automation
    3. Monitoring 
    4. Versioning
    5. Experiment tracking 
    6. Testing
    7. Documentation & Project Structure

### What is model governance in the context of ml-ops and what would be the key points if you explain this to a CEO?

  Model governance becomes non-optional as companies navigate impending EU regulations, underscoring the need for rigorous AI system categorization and compliance strategies.
  
  EU Regulation Overview
  
      ▪ April 2021 EU draft proposes the first legal framework for AI.  Categorizes AI systems by risk levels, determining regulatory requirements.

  #### key points if I would explain:
  
      AI Risk Categories
      
      ▪ Category 1: Unacceptable Risk
      High-risk AI (e.g., social scoring) banned to protect rights, security.
    
      
      ▪ Category 2: High Risk
      
      Stringent requirements for robustness, security, documentation, nondiscrimination, and transparency. Systems include credit scoring
      and educational access.
    
      
      ▪ Category 3: Limited Risk
      
      Transparency obligations, such as informing users when interacting with AI (e.g., chatbots).
      
      
      ▪ Category 4: Minimal Risk
      
      Low or no regulation needed (e.g., spam filters


### what is the connection between ml-ops and CI/CD?!


  CI/CD of ML pipelines enables teams to build source code, run tests, and deploy automated pipelines for continuous delivery and training. Encompasses model development, deployment, and monitoring with respect to adding layers for data versioning, model validation using tools, for examples, MLFlow, TFX, Kubeflow etc.


### Describe the MLOps infrastructure stack in two paragraphs?


  Ensuring that MLOPs have a business impact. and it is used for planning the cost of the infrastructure components for the MLOps stack by considering three main areas like data/code management, ML model and meta data management. Furthermore, It is used for planning the cost of the orchestration of the ML system to manage its life-cycle and maintainability by considering.
  
  In addition, It is paramount for designing the ML system to fulfill, reproducibility, for example, versioning, feature store, pipelines and reliability, and top of that efficiency with respect to model predictions are fast and as cost-effective as possible
